#Mead
**Mead **(/ˈmiːd/; archaic and dialectal "medd"; from Old English "meodu"[1] German: Меt, Ukrainian: Мед, Russian: Медовуха, Serbo-Croatian: Medovina/Медовина, Lithuanian: Midus, Farsi: مِی mey), is an alcoholic beverage that is produced by fermenting a solution of honey and water.[2] It may also be produced by brewing a solution of water and honey with grain mash, which is strained before or after fermentation.[3] Depending on local traditions and specific recipes, it may be flavored with spices, fruit, or hops[4] (which produce a bitter, beer-like flavor). The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV[5] to 18%. It may be still, carbonated or naturally sparkling, and it may be dry, semi-sweet or sweet.[6]
Mead is known from many sources of ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, although archaeological evidence of it is ambiguous.[7] Its origins are lost in history. "It can be regarded as the ancestor of all fermented drinks," Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat has speculated, "antedating the cultivation of the soil."[8]
Claude Lévi-Strauss makes a case for the invention of mead as a marker of the passage "from nature to culture."[9] Mead has played an important role in the beliefs and mythology of some peoples. One such example is the Mead of Poetry, a mead of Norse mythology crafted from the blood of the wise being Kvasir which turns the drinker into a poet or scholar.
Mead is not the same beverage as honey-wine however they are often confused with each other or thought to be the same beverage. While mead is made of honey, water and beer-yeast (barm), honey-wine is watered honey fermented by recrement of grapes (or other fruits).[10]
