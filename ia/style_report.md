#Style Report

##Style 1

All the colours of my styles have been based off of actual beer labels. Style 1 is a very partiotic American looking brand. I brought a gradient into the background to add depth aswell as texture to my website. The layout is very simple and buttons, buckets and division are minimal in appearance (just coloured blocks). I created a ribbon to be my nav to emphasize the links. Hover states and links are white to gold. All styles have a close up of a beer in a glass for obvious reasons.

##Style 2
Style 2 uses more warm, darker colours to bring in a pub/sports bar look and feel. A repeated background of grainy paper texture has been added to again, add depth. The nav is very basic and will remain stationary during site use. Buttons will carry over the same feel as the logo with the bow tie like shape.

##Style 3
Style 3 is very minamalistic. High contrast and easy navigation is the main focus. Larger than usual buttons will be used and asthetic detail will be cut to a minimum. This approach would be best used for smaller screen sizes.
