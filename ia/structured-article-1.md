#Lager
**Lager** (German: *storage*) is a type of beer that is fermented and conditioned at low temperatures. Pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer in the world. Bock, Pilsner and MÃ¤rzen are all styles of lager. There are also dark lagers, such as Dunkel and Schwarzbier. The term *Lager* is a cognate of *ligrs*, Gothic for "place of lying (down)".
